#### 情绪

最消耗能量的，不是体力上跑来跑去，而是精神情绪上的喜怒哀乐和苦思冥想，要想保持精力充沛，务必做到精神上不情绪化，平稳。外表看着在做事，内心上非常平静。

#### 运动

坚持每天进行有氧运动，最好在20分钟以上。开始学习传统的锻炼身体方式，最好是内家拳。

#### 饮食

尽量素食，晚饭少吃。吃东西不对会让头脑昏沉，不但对身体没好处，还会额外带来毒素。很多人把吃看的太重，乱吃，饮食不健康。

#### 松静

该做事的时候用精神做，没事的时候随时在休息状态。也就是说身体和头脑都在松静状态。

#### 兴趣

做喜欢做的事会激发潜力。做不喜欢的事会无精打采。<br/><br/>

1. **Drink lots of water during the day if you want to stay hydrated and energetic.** Water is the purest way of removing toxins from your body and revitalizing it. At the same time, you should try to reduce the amount of caffeine you consume in a day as it counteracts the benefits of your water intake by dehydrating the body. You may want to have a bottle of water next to you at all times so you can drink it even when you are enjoying a cup of coffee.<br/><br/>
2. **Change your eating habits by reducing the size of your main meals and adding healthy snacks, such as nuts, non-fat yogurt, and dried fruit, in between.** Eating in this manner will avoid food comas and maintain energy all day, just stay away from too many high sugar foods and carbohydrates.<br/><br/>
3. **Pause every now and then when at work so you can stretch your body and take deep cleansing breaths. ** This will help you feel rejuvenated. Sitting at your computer for long periods will lead to sleepiness and sluggishness, so get up periodically, stretch, breath, and move around. You may want to dedicate some of these mini breaks to chatting with colleagues, if possible, since socializing and laughter are both beneficial in picking up your spirits and energizing your attitude.<br/><br/>
4. **Include a brisk walk outside in your daily routine to break up your day, get your blood pumping, and refresh your mind.** You should also make time to visit a gym daily for a more robust exercise regimen that will not only keep you energized throughout the day, but it will help build your stamina and patience, and alleviate any stress you may be under.<br/><br/>
5. **Get the sleep your body and mind needs to feel revitalized.** In contrast, losing sleep just one night can take a week to repair. Therefore, aim for 7 hours rest at night and maintain a consistent sleep schedule so that your body and mind get used to it.<br/><br/>
6. **Incorporate a vitamin regimen to ensure that you are adhering to your required vitamin intake for the day, including energy promoting Vitamin C and B.**

#### Tips

- Rouse your circulatory system by rolling up and down on your toes.<br/>
- Avoid energy boosting drinks. These beverages usually promote energy but the results are often a short-term boost that's followed by a long-term energy slump.<br/>
- Invigorate your mind with a lavender-scented shower.
